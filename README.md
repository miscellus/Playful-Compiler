# Playful Compiler
This is just a toy compiler that I am tinkering with. Feel free to play along. (^:

As of writing this is just a calculator program that parses and evaluates math expressions.

## Quick Build
```
$ bash build.sh
$ ./build/calculator '1 + 2 * 3 + 4 ^ (2 - 1 * 2)'
```
Run without command line arguments to see options.

## Run Tests
```
$ bash test.sh
```
